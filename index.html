      <h2> Hi There!</h2>
      <p class = "Intro">
        I am Lahari Katepalli. I am a current graduate student at Portland state university Pursuing a Masters's degree in 
        computer science.  In the current time, new forward leaps in innovation appear to be limitless, and 
        new kinds of technology are rolled out every other second. I got inspired by computers 
        when I understood I could start programming and it was an intrigue that kept on developing as I took more 
        computer science engineering courses. Although I do not have any experience in the actual software field, 
        I did acquire the basic software skills required through my bachelor's degree. As a result of the projects 
        that I worked on I developed a keen interest in areas like Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence, and data science. 
        In the coming years, I wish to become a software developer. I intend to play a substantial role in 
        developing technologically sophisticated solutions for the societal problems that we face globally.
